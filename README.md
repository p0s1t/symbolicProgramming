PROLOG code from my time spent studying symbolic programming in school

A collection of some fairly low-level, though educational, code using PROLOG, a non-OOP language.

This code comes from my Symbolic Programming class, which I got a lot out of and learned the strengths inherent in languages like PROLOG and LISP. It's very heavy on recursion, so I learned a lot about that, and also about creating rule based algorithms that can self-modify, which I find fascinating.
